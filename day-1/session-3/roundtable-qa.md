lukas, filmmaker artist

- time based media, idea of capturing time

- started studing environmental sciences, maybe you can comment on that
  later

- this is landscape 3.0, landscape is the obvious character in it
they are somehow really special, postapocaliptic, prehuman

a. the landscapes how i choose it, i isolate myself a little bit
started working with landscape 2010
did first stormhunting series, waiting in the middle of nowhere
then did projects in arctic, oil platforms, deserted places

doing a dialogue inside the landscape

mirna. can you just briefly tell me about where your films where filmed

rain of silence
hightide - 7m20 2013
lowtide

all shot in the arctic, sailing around spitsbergen

impact of time, how you perceive time at these different spaces

`showing film`

---

q. in this film you have a situation in the beginning and the end, and then
a intervention in the middle.

a. yes, during the intervention it causes change, human time

q. here it forms almost like a narrative, was this something that you
had in mind

a. i think it came with the film, first we were driving with the boat up
the stream, then it was a small intervention, moving the stearing wheel
and then circling there

q. yesterday we talked about nature as a spectacle, critique of this
sublime nature. it also connect to your new project, dying rivers

a. i'm using urany as a kind of tracing colour that you use to trace
well etc.
like in hightide and rain of science i like that the beginnen and end
are the same. so during the intervention it turns green and then at the
end it turns normal again.

we go to the second film, 14minutes

`captive horizon`

---

filmed with a quadcopter, about size and distance
you hear steps, different sound. you loose sense a bit, then you start
floating.

q. it seems to come from a mode of control, did you work with drones
before

a. no, it was my first project with it, it's such a powerful tool. I
could just film a crater even though it was officially closed, just fly
over it. many opportunities open

q. there is a moment in the real landscape where it seems to become
fabricated, did you manipulate the image, did you shoot it like that

a. nothing was manipulated, except this part where there is a shadow on
the ground, we were very close to the ground

q. following the landscape, the elements, natural things of nature, can
you tell me where you are going now?

a. next project with vanja smiljanic 2011 total eclipse in australia

30 minute steady camera, with second runrise, called double dawn

20 march in .. islands to document another eclipse
