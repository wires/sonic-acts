Q. a: although your lecture is about .. how does an object oriented view
of the world help us in understanding this important of what is
happening with our earth

A. g: well certainly, modern politics split between truth and power
politics
any state / politic actor that does ... without thinking about
environemnt is going to end up in trouble

didn't hear marxist come up with a good answer to gaia

Q a. marc, important issue, what science is doing, bringing forward
"facts", problem it has, the way it is perceived in dealing with hard
facts

A m. frustrated by the way scientist presented in the media. one week
presented with fact P. next with with fact not-P

he as scientist tries to deal with quantifying the amount of uncertainty
and change on the surface of the earth

A Timothy morton: (i sound like the dwarf in twin peaks)

science <-> .. almost oppposite
if applying for money, "you know 'm just a human being with my knowledge
	candy, let met just sprinkle it on this knowledge cupcake"

if science, don't make ontological assumptions, have to be ver pure in
	what you are seeing

what we are doing is we are supporting the object like qualities of
things

unspeakable futurality

funnily enough
we do things
science does appearances
things are not candy
appearances are not factoids

Q a. douglas, you talk was about energies at first magnitute
how does smelling of ozone, .. connect to the worldview that graham
harman is putting forward

A d kahn. first of all i'm not a filosopher. what i have notices is when
objects and things are talked about filosphically tey are different
things.
talk about difference between force<->matter, outsie of filosphical
framework. 
eg. pierre schaefer, sound as an object. doesn't go over very well.
sound and light are at their basis energies
they are either moving, or potention
they don't obey certain... , it's hard to pinpoint any location
exists sort of spatial logic
there exists a discreteness that we associate with objects, but this
doesn't work with energetic things

graham:
I'll spec in favour of obejct
object is something superficial
in OOO we don't use obect that way
it covers anything, cartoon characters, square circle

object does usually mean a durable object, that persists

its something that is not the sum of its parts, it's something inbetween
have to start with something as broad
instead of descartes that humal are somehow special

timothy:

energy; as physist little dot. but what is interesting is that they are
not static lumps.

filosophical problem of treating the earth like a static things

movement is exactly the thing that makes this hard.
things do move without mechanical input
if you have cause-effect theory, then you cannot explain motion

funny thing about quatized little bits they are shimmering

eg. place something in near absolute zero
e.g. little mirror, starts emitting light
so it becomes more to like an object

objects shimmer without mechanical input
^ that could be on my graveston

should try to reduce them to paradoxical plastic lumps, because they are
not

Q a: as a scientist what you are you getting from the stories of
douglas, ..

A mark.
very intersting, earht is constantly changing, yet we have this idea
that the world is static
wether there are humans or not the world is going to change

we can also contribute to a system of the earth that is in a really good
state. instead of decimate biodiversity, we can make it flourish
we have an opportunity to do this as humans

Q a: what a fact is, how we can have acces to a world outside of the
human-object relation

A mark. what I found from this meeting is that we all really need to work
together, Scientists see the world different from filosphers, artists,e
tc.

we need a common worldview

Q a. Tim, you came up with the term dark ecology, phrase "climate
catostromy is not going to happen, it has already ahppened"

imagining that the end has already happened, we are living in a new
era. form of melancholie, get to terms as a human

A t. i'm with you that this is a moment for all hands on deck
any skill that you have can be used with devotion to something that
isn't you. somhow, when i say "were already dead" im' not say oh great.
we don't exist, dont be horriefied. i' not saying that

emotionally i am trying to get people over some kind of filosphical
speedbumb to allow non-humand beings to exist in our art etc

we keep thinking that the earth is going to end, but then we freeze.
it's going the happen we might just do whatever.

better to think : we *did* put the coal in the oven, antropocene is
already started.

better to realize it's already happening, ok ok I have paranoia,
whatever, just live with it.

animism, indigenous culture, things play: their way of saying object
shimmer without ...

ohno neoliberalism is this monsters, let's retweet this idea that we
cannot do anything about it.

precisely of interdepence there is always a thing missing
cannot be nice to the bunnies, but then you are not nice to the
bunny-paracites.

we've all become hypocrites, i'm happy with that.
ecology for slightly depressed freaky people, artists, who feel left
out. goth-ecology. eyeliners, weird zombies.
all their desires are a little perverted, etc, that is fine. like a
treehugger, that is a bit twisted, but it's good, you cannot get rid of
it.

why cannot this be ecological. My sense is it can be

A d.

in australia, drought, etc. there is a lot of evidence of the
catastrophic nature of climate change. fires used to go over
Eucalipus forrest and after that there is a regeneration and flourish.
now superfires that go into the ground and after the fire nothing is
left.

then elect tony abbot. he is putting things in reverse. lets open up
mining. Things are going in reverse.
i'm not as sanguis aout it

hypocrazy vs. criminality

not just talking about oil spills, talking about funding, backroom deals
that go about opening another coal mine. Some routing thing that is one
acriminal levle.

ecopath, anal. to sociopath

has same temporal dimension, socioligy in restrospect
allowing a situation to develop that will allow a lot of oeple do die
bangladesh, .. island

deep time view, we need to start talking about criminal actions that
bring about deaths in the future

ecopaths are sociopaths, not personal hypocritisism

more worried about people that wil cause this death.
personally it has to do with my kids etc.

Questions from audience.

Q. what is the use of OOO for the problem of antropocene, if not to only
trigger a accelerationist response.

A t. think about this a lot, i think about attitutes. you can think
about anything, it's not what you think it how you think that kills
plants and stuff.

i'm not an acccccelllllerrrrationist it a masochistic reponse.

dude freaks out... [heckler]

you have a lot of energy.

i'm getting there. i'm a clumsy guy that doesn't get everything right.
i appreciate the energy you are showing there, i have the same kind of
energy

so if i'm going to talk directly about the whimsical.

to me whimsical doesn't mean superficial...

[freaks out more]

can you let met finish? i'm not very good at answering question, need to
talk around it a bit.

timothy mentions acceleration and winks and points...

LOL (I lost it here...)

Q a. about the nature/culture divide. does it play are role in the OO
arg

A graham. in latours phil makes the case that many entries are now hybrids,
what is nature what is culture. It doesn't make sense that its good to
have two ontologies. I think he makes a mistake here. [...]
you find few to no scientist that liek latours approach.
i think he has a harder time to talk to scientist than OOO peeps

---

Q a. 

A mark. we almost think of ourselves seperate from nature. after lunch i
was asked to give an interview, then I referred to the human and nature
but

idea's of catastrophism. nature is in a new state now in which humans
are a mayor component. It doesn't have to mean that we have to push the
planet through this catastrofee.
it's not yet happening, but if we don't do then in 100 years we destroy
the earth. We haven't got there yet, so we can still do it.

A t. talking about filosphical catastrophy, psychological catastrophe
who we think we are is confusing things, so let's change that.
