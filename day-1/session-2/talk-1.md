# graham harman

speak about anthropocene as ontologist

associated with two

- speculative realism
- OOO

in common

realist philosophies

cannot talk about the world of the human in itself,
only about correlations between ..

you are interested in a world without humans

q: what does art look like without humans

SR and OOO guilty of art without humans

book garcia: form and objects

disagree: art without humans makes no more sense then
basketball without humans

position on:
overmining, undermining

advance philosophies, object are naive

presocratic thinkers

Q: what is everything made of
what is the ultimate element that everything is made of

- everything made of water
- air even more neutral medium than water (compress it you get metals
  etc)
- earth, air, water, joined by love, separeted by hate

aperon

- boundless, everything emergens from it

objects are too superficial

need to break them down into some ultimate medium where everything is
made of

pre-individual, becoming, everything is changing, there are no
individuals

problem: this cannot explain emerge

eg. amsterdam same city one century to the next

thing is not that dependent on it's tinyest parts

objects are not too shallow, but too deep

bruno latour: every entity is just the sum of it's actions

transfoms modifies perturbs creates

problem, thing has no surplus beyond what it does

can't really explain change this way

aristotle
no one is a house building unless he's building a house right now

q: what about a sleeping house builder?

a: potentiality

thought, graham doesn't really like this term

people are doign both at once

paramedi..lis, duality

sense is deceiving us,
everything is one, everything is being
everything is being, opinions

what is missing, is the middle ground

four groups of filosophers that do take care of this

two kinds of knowledge

q: what is something

a: what it is made of
a: what it does (more popular now)

not able to talk about what it might do

eddington most famous for observations of eclipses
also used to be very famous for his two tables metafour

physical table: mostly empty space, particles whizzing around
other table: pracitcal, can move around, has a certain price, feel solid

everything has a manifest image and a scientific image

but both are images

do we really want to commit to a world that is just images?

it's wrong.

He thinks there is a third table, inbetween the two tables.

artist are looking at the third table

good scientific work: find two kinds of knowledge about electron
- what it is(made of) and what is does

artwork doesn't do this, it doesn't say what its made of or what it does

cannot simply say it's 10% canvas, 20% arcrylic, etc..
also cannot say it makes me feel good, bla

in both cases you are missing something

similar to filosophy.

filosophic is not a form of knowledge, it is not a form of mathematics

socratis never give a definition of virtue, love, etc...

filosophia means "love of wisdom", not wisdom

OOO tried to re"-pick this up.."


saying thing, but not in a direct proposition
always have to approach it sideways and obliquely

literary critics call this "paraphrase"

poem cannot be replaced by it's explanation
joke if you explain it is ruined

let me turn to arts for a minute

touched on the antophocene

.. greenberg, godfath 40-60 avantgarde art newyork
artwork has a certain autonomy

he tought like literary critics

came out of fashing late 1960'

defended by fried, essay art and objecthoods

critique minimalist artists

- minimalist are literalists, artworks have not aestatic depth (just a
  block + wire etc..)

literalism

- theatricality, he is against this. personal gut hatred, doesn'ty like
  it in opera etc.. touches human

other dude: thinks art should be both

problem, they think it's the same
graham says, there is a split there

art is something deeper than it's current effects
- position in galery
- polical response, etc

an antwork can be an antwork if a human isn't there (fried)

salt is still salt if the chlorine is gone

art is a compound object containing humans

typically 'art without humans' then make art that scares humans

---

how is this split possible
- artwork as something observed
- 

- humans as observers
- humans as ingredients

wants to discuss society without humans
i know that sounds ridiculous

when you ask that question, you are asking two different things

society as an object is a mistery to us, and probably will remain

we don't understand things that we are part of

this gives us a new way to read old maxim "artis minesis" ?

aristotle, great powers are the ones that drool and shout when they
talk their poems

method acting, become the rock

art of passionate involvements

interesting it's coming up elsewhere in filosophy
badiou (sartre, pasquale)
logic of worlds

view both art and filosophy as theatrical but not literal

cannot reduce an object to a bundle of qualities

have to say that there is an object about it
object is a non literal thing

has to be human involvement in art, even in truth

antromorphic / antropocentric

antropocentric := everything evolves around humans (kant)
antromorphic := need to ascribe human features to other things

hegel: there isn't a real thing outside of thoughts

shouldn't have happened, we need to get rid of kants stpid 'thing in
itself'

all objects all trapped.

when fire burns cotton, it doesn't make contact with all aspects of
cotton.

panpsycics (even in bertrant russel)

nothing makes direct contact with anything else

jane bennet: sometimes antromorphic is needed to counteract
antropocentrism

q: is the antropocene antromorphic or antropocentric
a: neither

humans are both ingredients and observers

we are ingredient: helped caused it

but also don't control it:

humans don't really understand the climate
it's unmasterable in the practical sense, cannot reverse it


now about the politics of this

- which filosopher talks most about antrophonese
latour lectures about gaia

- prince of networks 2009
- 2014 graham published a book on latours politics

never understand something until you write a book about it

rather quickly when researching the book, q. arose: where is latour on
the political scale: left-right?

sometimes bit of both, sometimes jumps left-right

latour is hard to place on this scale
- not a radical lefts
- bizarly progressive ideas (SF to some people)

ultimately, it's not a relevant spectrum for latour

state of nature

- left: inequality is obvious moral outrage
- right: people are stabbing eachother, etc



hobbsian view of how people are

maybe not hobbsian state of nature

latours state of nature? doesn't have one

interesting essay about babboons

wedding rings, bank accounts, passports. that is what makes it
impossible for us to live like babboons
wake up realize where we are in the hierachy etc..

despicing scientist

philosphy of victory

not good to have scientific truth, but not convince everyone

1991 change
hobbs does not allow transcendce, the leviathan has to ..
(in religion)

hobbs thought the same about science

interesting essay about
hobbs/boyle conflicting interpreation of air pump

scientist win because they convice allies
pastour won because he first persuaded the hygentists, then the ...

hobbs was wrong. politics is just a suspect as nature

everyting is about a negotiation between actors

latour politics of nature
scientist and moralist back into politics

it's not just a powerstorm

need scientist to detect entities that are currrently unknown (climate
change)

moralist need to explain well this country is doing that and that

2003-2005 in latour politics (OO politics)

get it's directly from noortje
dissertation about walter lithman, john dewey debate

people vote for trivial reasons
ultimately USA is destined to become a technocracy

dewey: don't have an opinion about everything

noortje: issues define the public

public jumps in when issues comes up

nobody ever has the final answer to a political dispute

---

I like to think about the issue of egytian water
99% desert

except for couple of oasis, the nile is the main water source

1940s treaty between egypt (sudan etheopia ..)
1970s president stated that they will bomb any nile ban build by anybody
else than egypt

treaty signed under british occupation

egypt: you have rain

others: you are wasting so much water

egypt: yeah but you too

it's not a truth
smithian reason (carl smith)
sovereign decide, existential struggle

liberals are more cynical
smith just says: they are not evil, just need to be eliminated
hobbs: idea of leviathan is to prevent the violence
smith: wants to bring violence back into the politics

left likes smith even tough he's a nazi

gaia does not exist until we politcally recognize it
opposite what james lovelock meanth (its already here and going to mess
with us)

latour: all the is possible, smithian warfare

we can't argue with climate change sceptics anymore, just need to beat
them.

antrophocene politics of gaia
latour antropocentric politics of gaia
