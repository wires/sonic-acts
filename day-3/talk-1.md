15M dump trucks of dust around the globe every year

sediment budgets (incoming / outgoing)

sediment sink, 25.000 dump trucks of sediment transported into the
pacific

problem with this sediment transport, city of santa cruz

flow of sand is depleted, rivers blocked

---

amsterdam harbour, massive disturbance of flow 

what is the anthropogenic influence of global sediment flux

---

current sediment flux: ~13 gt/yr
"pristine" pre-anthropocene flux:  ~15 gt/yr (say pre 1700)

doesnt seem too big

behind the nrs some disturbing facts

---

ways that we have increased dramatically

- deforrestation, erosion
- agriculture
- messing around with rivers
- through the scale of our digging around

also descreased,

- building dam
- the scale of dam building

40k large (>15m) worldwide

all recent construction

1915 very few, by now more than 75k damns

---

so we've increased and decreased by trapping behind damn.
how to measure it?

glines dam, elwha river dam removal.

70km long river, not very big.
however, the sediment is running out and building a new delta.

for relatively modest river,it's about 3M dump trucks

---

estimates worldwide trapped behind dams is 5-60 GT/yr
take modest mid-nr, 25GT/yr trapped

if all of that were liberated, not all would make it to the ocean.

let's say reduction in flux to oceans is 14GT/yr

current flux in the absence of dams: 27GT/yr

=~ 2 x pre-Anthropocene flux

we have increased the rate of landscape change by a rate of two

river sediment loads: changes during the anthropocene
Syvitski and kettner, 2011

started building cities, this caused it.

---

huanghe (yellow) river; loess plateau

plateau of fragile, but very fertile ground
lots of agriculture

two dams already on this river

pre antropocene: soil erosion due to deforestation,
reduction due to dams


---

when we look downstream,

used to enter into the yellow sea

now into bo hai sea

river migration hugely constrained by construction

---

further south

yangtze river
50K dams in the catchment area

20 large dams under construction

here is the problem:
at the mouth of the delta is shanghi

water withdraw and chocking of natural supply of sediment

growth of delta reduced

niger delta sinking 10cm per year.

---

china rapantly building dams

"every river that is carrying water out of china is a waste of chinese
water"

what about neighbouring countries... :-(

---

sand mining in those rivers

- for construction but also for
- mineral, iron, titanium rich

100M tonnes per year

most of it illegal, by local sand maffia, on a enormous scale

supplied singapore

---

not just in china. it's a global problem

because it's illegal you can't get at the nrs

you can have the 

---

official dredging

ridiculous process we call "beach nourischment"

just to replenish beaches lost, just because we stopped the natural flow
of sediment

china building islands, to establish it's new frontiers.

---

3GT of sand just for the dubai palm.

took it out of local marine environment

that doesn't even include all the sand they imported from australia to
make the concrete for the buildings

---

krausmann et al. 2009

moving stuff around in the anthropocene

26GT/yr of sand and gravel for concrete

1.3 billion dump trucks
stand by the road for 200 years at rate of 6 trucks per min

took it from environment and lock it into conrete

---

documentary "sand wars" denis delestiac

---

bookKeeping is essential

- massive disruption to the earths sediment budgets

- sand is arguably an unsustainable resource

the special sand that we need into concrete

special sand to extract titanium to paint our refridgerators white.

we cannot escape the anthropocene,

but think about our world,

build a better anthropocene, one that is less anthropic and less ..

us as wester culture

has anyone talked to an australian aboriginal about what they think?
