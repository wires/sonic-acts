dynamic between natural computation and 

the stack:

- earth layer
- cloud
- city
- address
- interface
- user

it is a mistake to imagine computation as something that came into
existing when computers came into being

it's also wrong to imagine computaiton as existing on some dry plane
without influence water, etc..

irrespective of the algorithmic limitations ..

earth understood as a layer
stack is hungry

substances that force communication

silicon is far from the only substance needed for its functioning

phones, etc contain dozen minerals

congo, tantulum, gold, wolferite...
pulled by hand form mines, typically children

congo civil war

smoldering war (partially) funded by the smartphone profits

increase in bushmeat because need for minerals moved into gorilla
terrain

*computer is revolting*

the stack terraforms it's host parent

little computer brick

electronic waste.

the stack comes a mean to ..

geographic, geology and geodesy

skin is the largest sensory organ of the human body

climatic measurement, prediction
global weather systems has been a driving force bething planetary sensing

financialized molecules

indecypherable accounting paradoxes

cannot modify what you cannot monitor
<=>
cannot not modify what you sense

quantify the anthropocene

---

some years ago panel on HP scientists

asked by al gore, to build a computer that could simulate and monitor in
real time the entire earth system.

conclusion

- zetaflops required
- size of paris

anticlimacticly:

so much energy, that single most significant event it itself would be
monitoring

anthropocene: the shortest geological period ever

de-technologize the planet and rehumanize ourselve
^ it is the worst idea ever

brain eating apes with weaponized hydrogen atoms

other precies

i argue that animal, vegetable and esp. mineral, would agree
