Trident submarine, HMNB, Clyde, Faslane, Scotland, March 2013

- grampian 450M yr old mountains

- urium 238 to make the warheads is much older, 4.5B yrs (age of the earth)

- fission in the reactor created plutonium 239
  halflife of 24000 yrs

- next stage, after they are expoded
  iodine 129, 15.7 M yrs halflife

civilian~milliar application of nuclear

potential of fear and destruction

in britain 24 old submarines rusting and waiting to be dismantled

british gov. opened up a public consultation process

nuclear decision making has always outside public domain

60 yrs too late democracy

now that they are rusting public is involved

(heideggers broken tool)

300-500m below ground a storage.

russion submachine reactors stored outside

german waste in saltmine

forsmark nuclear waste reposity

lots of waste they have no idea off

difference between disposal and storage

resource extraction

new channenge of storing radioactive waste

reengineer was back underground, back in the background

research programs that deal with ..

latours at network theory as investigative model

testing the long scale safety pretty much impossible due to the long
timescale

URL underground research laboratory

heat transfer, etc.

EU directive that every nation should have a strategy for building 

simulated with heaters, not actual radioactive materials

possibly a failure of research

cant mark for future generations

actinium field trip hokkaido japan
farmer kuse and his cows.

artists anthropologists, arthistorias, activist, curators

under this site is the proposed site.

process very slow.

10-20 yrs just to get the license

100 yrs to build

then more to be filled

somtimes over 100.000 to fill.

visitor center horonobe japan 2014

---

undergroup vaults are really being build

nature doesn't proliferate because there is radiation, but because there
are no humans.

reindeer branding, lift shaft horonobe

also moved a herd of raindeer

---

waste mixed with glass
(black glass)

canister packed with .. clay

packed with plastic to prevent it to dray

vitrified waste canisters, 2000w thermic load

stored above ground for at least 60+ iyears

when heat has decayed to 500 watts

they can go underground for 100.000

glass is black because it cracks due to the heat

---

URL (350m) setup as a education thing

fault lines, water channeling, drainage pipes

artist interface visible/non visible

field trip, JAEA japan, RAWRA czech republic

URL bure, nothern france sept 2014

real site, not test

500m undegroun

hotel, visitor center,

strong naritive around nature

---

cell for waste canisters

white tube is a cell

whole process is planned automated

surface research lab, drift and cell

---

inside drift, looking into a cell

most of the testing seems to be about getting the canisters into the
cell and the heat transfer

kota kaeuchi, from the moment of recording it beame peeping, 2001

screen movie capture of his desktop following fukushima meltdown

news sites, live streaming, watching in disbelief watching the
explosions at the powerplant.

what is significant about this work, is that he was able to respond in a
considered way

museum has collected a nr of works to document the fukushima disaster

art history has a pretty good process to document, much better than ..

---

material analysis of the nuclear cycle reveals that thing cannot and
will not simply disappear


general feeling seems to be that science has run out of language to ..

in the age of the anthropocene we cannot

how to communicate long timescales and acros generations

radiation as a hyperobject; deep time

kota takeuchi, take stone monuments twice, 2013

from economic history in the modern age of iwaki ichiro saito 1976

picture of town near fukushima prefecture

old book about site makers in the prefecture

revisited the site after the nuclear disaster

static markers of just one generation

nuclear semiotics

find a language that we can communicate in 100000 years

---

digital and stone media

between a monument and a site maker

monument as a rememberence, where site marker as a warning for future

LLW ltd, drigg, cumbria 2013

low level waste limited site

little brother of salafield

almost surface waste storage

there is a herron, it's all fine.


antique radio-active waste storage;

can't move them because they are wedged into the site

they will eventuall be coverred by a human interference stuff

metal, rocks, etc, finally covered by a mountain

---

what is it that we are trying to mark, what kind of knowledge do we want
to embed and know.

sites? decay rates?

actually decay rate is what is missing.

proposed to build nuclear semiotic totems

count down decay rate

present decay rates as an abstraction

---

started talking about radioactive objects

how do they sit as markers in the nuclear anthropocene

---

cecile massart, un site archive pour alpha, beta, gamma

whole series of prints and films that show the one vision of the nuclear
age.

mark the site, a precious link between generations

human interference task force

rather then to communicat to the deep future

it's not a problem of past/future but of the continuing present

cumbian alchemy: atomic priest at castlerigg

.. thought he is completely mad

asked him to write a paper on semiotic markers

proposed an atomic priesthoud, as religion has been a good stable thing

been voted agains, then whitepaper

---

netherlands willem we.. site? 

robert williams

cubrian alchemy

nuclear archive in it's broadest cultural form

institutions can no longer take responsibility
so now it's released responsibility into the public realm

archives also in the public domain, doesn't have to tell a singular
story. can be different narritives
