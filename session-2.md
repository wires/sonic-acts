Arie: Recommended reading, douglas book (... signal)

# douglas kahn

not going to get a polished talk from me, ever :-)

book, 12 yrs of research

## energies at earth magnitude

- talk about geologics, heliologics

- two different gazes
- appealing to the stars
- accros the earth

earth was excluded from these two gazed

- lunar eclipse
- until solar balloons, blue marble, biggest selfie ever?
- massive energy requirements to take that photo

- broader range of energies, not limited by light & sight
- signals received that noone was sending
- example, earthquakes, tele-sysmology
- also used during war
- 1889, marconi ~ cornwall (Hilel schwartz, making noise)
- came from a long line of such disturbances
- e.g. when the first telephone was first developed
- .5 mile long metalic line about boston, listening to radio 20yrs before first
  radio
- it is nature
- various such disturbances: lightning storms
- lines of telegraph system covered very large surface
  - distributed sensing array
  - telemetry
- so they were earth scale scientific intruments
- communications tech not solely about communication (claim from his
  book)
- natural radio, "musical atmospherics" (late 19 century)
- with noone sending
- live communication vs. storage (grammophone, etc)

- deresonated version of geologic
- role of geologists in fracking, etc; speeding up the process
- they should stop digging those holes

- sun as energy orb
- oldschool wildernis exists around the entire heliosphere

- earth scale things begin with hiroshima, nagasaki
- global self awareness of tangible self extinction

- look at both in terms of energy
- bringing the power of the sun down to earth
- reverse icarus

- global warming: a slow burn of the old sun from underground
  (energy trapped by global synthesis)

- shock and awe energy war
- is a heliologic in the geologic
- solar terrestial environment, coal phase

rest of talk, get out of the sun, solar light

- get back into terrestial light, in particular, lightning

- mentioned andre breton
- d. kahn wrote essay to understand the work of david haines, using lightning

thinking about some specificaiton of energy
- ontology of energy?
- cosmology vs cosmogeny

examine energy
- sensory experience vs ...
- (light art, sound art, narrowband focus)
- however this is broader band examination

test whenever light is invoken
q: whatever other energy is present
how do they look, sound smell
how do they work
where do they come from and where do they go
temporal and spatial properties

- NY eve in sidney, fireworks display around the bridge
- celebration of 100.000s to watch choreographed flashes, shockwaves, smell of
  explosives

- electrial storms, similar, but unscheduled. so no participants present

- so many lightning strikes, turned night into day, with flashes of
  black

- so unreal, he understood why andrea breton wanted to import it
- 19.. manifest by him

- peotic images are not ... but "formed by juxtaposition of two or more distant realities"

- electric of peotic structure
- cross the gap

thinking about vandergraaf generator

- if the gap is small: steady string of unremakable sparks
- if gap is bigger: fewer sparks
- gap to big, nothing happens

self illuminating peotics, just before the gap is too big

- breton; day and night roll into one and another (waking/dreaming) ~
(conscious/unconscious)

- most beautiful night of all, lightning filled night

- kahn doesnt mind importing this into the unconsciouness

- provide relief from the constant import of computer chips etc into the
  neuroscience

- delay of thunder, as it echo's over the earth surface

- crack of deafening when it opens the space, nearby lightning

- sound energy

- hearing searing, superheated air

- full spectrum of lightning strikes also has radio waves (travelling at
  spead of light)

- kahn prefers to listen to athmospheric cracles on his AM radio
  (instead of the crappy programming on it)

..

- when traveling on right flux lines can travel six earth radia into
  space, and come back into space

- whistlers

- instead of geopolitical sisters, rather use conjugate points

humans changes teresstial light, (weather, climate)

so every lightning strike has human influence in it

- .. brings smells into the world of frequencies
- smell of ozone in the lightning
- hebrew: breath of God, not only bad breath, has to be toxic
- (thats the real reason he rarely speaks to people)
- if you get struck by lightning you smell the touch of god
- kahn was struct himself, thought his (no existent) hair was melting
  :-)
- lightning flower on skin, perfume of it is ozone and burning blood

- "ethereal fluid that flowed like blood in the vains of the god"

use of perfumes this way

- aroma released from drying clay captures in oil
- earth smell (greeks?)

- existence of ozone in higher athmosphere, 
  particular relevant for australians

- hole in ozone layer; skin cancer

- smell of hairspace, shaving cream

- slowing down ozone depletion as sign of success
  obama said it evern "hopeful moment .. if we can do that!"

- however earosols easier to curtain than car exhaust, etc

- manufacturers of copying machines published glossy brochures,
  not to worry about ozone.

- seems then our faith determined by energy politics

What then are the poetics, aesthetics of ... ?
