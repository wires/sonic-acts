brave new now

(shows a animateion with everythign samsungnized)

i'm an architect, not some crazy sonic architect

story of a visionary present

brave new now, imaginary world that exists from things we visited

physical landscape. .. nomadic studio

speculative architecture of film and ficture that we extract from now

exaggerating the present

we exaggerate the world to reveal phenomena

tonights program we will call 
city everywhere
kim kahardashian and the dark side of the screen

at the same time the city is nowwhere and everywhere
it has become a network of landscapes .. accros the landscape


from our digital cultures from the holes in the ground, etc.

the google earht sattelite

a pixel is less than .5 meter of size

acientcraftsman used to measure the earth using human ..
units based on length of arm

when the dominant processes..

what happens?

kimye happens

kim is the future 

all to evenly distributed

a new species, the netowrk, not just her physical self, to think about
kimye and the city they imagine that they cast a shadow accros ...
physical and digital space

we listen to the sounds of her .. husband stretched and slow down so
they become just barable *lalz*

when we stroke kimye on our screen, she is photoshopped perfect.

our community is not something we log on to, our city must be

kim measures her age in phone generated

remember when we had the iphone 3GS, oh i was so happy there.
