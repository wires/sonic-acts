for those that attended my performance you know that i'm intrested in
instruments, building instruemnts

also for investiging other things besides music

originally commisioned by tromsø

includes the creation of new music instruemnts

performance on beeren eyland, in barentz sea

named by dutch baretz, after attacked by bear

balthazar keelhou, cadaver of the earth beause of complete lack of
vegetation

after looking at 1000s photographs i was looking for a particular
landscape, or rather a way that a landscape can effect your eyes.

between norway and svalbard

soon some fotographs of this island stood out
i will show some

as you can see, the fotographs have a sort of pre modernist look

like thimoto o sullivan and his like

landscapes without any obvious points of recognition

made of pure lines and deep ..

otherness, unhabitable, desolate

only people of great experience and knowledge can endevour

scientist deliberately exhibited nature as a exotic .. place ready to be
concuored by science. to get funding for next project.
artists do similar thing

exploring unfamiliar landscape.
process of approciationg

whether exploring for 

- politics
- science
- art

the eye of the explorer cannot not be possesive about the pictures

will now show *eye tracking* on the images
(wow, cool)

---

next step, go there in person

questions i was thinking baout, is how being there would affect the
senses, change the way we view it

needless to say,it's not the easiest place to reach

found expedition of nordic historians that we going to reenact the
moments of explorers

there is only a metorological station with 6 people.

6 days on foot, sleeping in huts that metereologic people were keeping

installed the first instruemnts

---

he looks at the landscape while and eye tracking device triggers
solenoids that ring tuning forks

(very cool)

---

yeah, as i mention in the beginning the bear island is the cadaver of
the earth, but now I can also conclude that it's 80% of the time also
fog. not the best place for an eye tracking device.

eyes have two basic motions

- saccades
- fixations

this becomes a very peculiar experience. you get audible feedback with
what you are seeing.

you become aware of your eyes are moving, you are hearing your eyes in a
way.

being a musician i immediately started composing with my eyes.

----

let me show some more of the island, it's not a cadaver actually.

you are all asking, did he meet polar bears??
sadly/luckily, no. depending how you look at it.
they have not been seen on the island for many years, because the ice is
receding.

what the island does have is bird, millions of birds.

on the south of the island there is the largest colony of sea birds at
the souther hemisphere

did some eyetracking here as well.

*video*

(it's beautiful)

there were also some prints, there are now at university of tromsø
