for those that attended my performance you know that i'm intrested in
instruments, building instruemnts

also for investiging other things besides music

originally commisioned by troms√∏

includes the creation of new music instruemnts

performance on beeren eyland, in barentz sea

named by dutch baretz, after attacked by bear

balthazar keelhou, cadaver of the earth beause of complete lack of
vegetation

after looking at 1000s photographs i was looking for a particular
landscape, or rather a way that a landscape can effect your eyes.

between norway and svalbard

soon some fotographs of this island stood out
i will show some

as you can see, the fotographs have a sort of pre modernist look

like thimoto o sullivan and his like

landscapes without any obvious points of recognition

made of pure lines and deep ..

otherness, unhabitable, desolate

only people of great experience and knowledge can endevour

scientist deliberately exhibited nature as a exotic .. place ready to be
concuored by science. to get funding for next project.
artists do similar thing

exploring unfamiliar landscape.
process of approciationg

whether exploring for 

- politics
- science
- art

the eye of the explorer cannot not be possesive about the pictures

will now show *eye tracking* on the images
(wow, cool)
