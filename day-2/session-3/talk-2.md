shows image from NY, bird on ruins... (sad)

nikkle, images of trash

open landscape, factory, the center of it, spweing out this smoke

after being there i saw so many pipes spewing smoke.
it's hard to breathe, we have it everywhere, leaving ths all over the
place.

it's fascinating these ruins that we leave behind.

and the smoke, sulfur dioxide for instance coming out of this particular
one. we put it in the air and it comes down somewhere we don't know
where.

on the border of norway and russia, dark image of factory.

enthusiastic about oil coming, already preparing for the oil from
russian.

all the areas are prepared

new agreement on serviet, very quickly it has been drafted,
norway<->russia.

very recently the are talking about moving the sea ice edge further
north, because you are not allowed to drill there, because in case of
accident.

times are changin, i've seen political changes

antoher project i'm working on is in gothlan(?)

type of statue, 400M yrs old, created by corals.

then again we make factories to make this process faster, to grind this
faster, also in gottlan.

silencing our own reef.

this is a reef in dominican republic.

studying wether the coral can grow back, it died due to bacterial
infection, because biodiversity is not very big there

team with underwater photographer. rueben is measuring up area for
growing back, and whether illegal fishing is influencing this

reefs makes a good place for humpbacks to give birth, they have been
coming there.

let me play sounds

- toadfish (wuurrr wurr wurrrrp sound)
- spawning aggregation in panama
- seithe hunting (cod, norwegian pollock)

the problem is the illegal fishing

cannot say from a pretty luxurious boat that you cannot do this, because
that is how you make their living.
they dive 8 hours up and down.

parrot fish, they eat of the .. from the coral, so the coral larve can
grow better

picture of a coral

took samples and then bread them out, and plant differnt genetypes

when the stress factor becomes too many, it's also a question of how
much you can take.

i'll show you an installation with this kind of sounds

.. no time..

recent piece I did this summer, it's called Dive

had different kind of marine area's so you could walk from shallow to
deep sea in a tunnel. It was a piece for 8 speakers, two subs.
