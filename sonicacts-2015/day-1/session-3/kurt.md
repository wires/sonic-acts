everyone exhausted? i am
thanks sonic act, lucas, annette, great to be back

put in some praise, it is really a unique place. there is something
exceptionally inspiring about sonic acts (thanks to stedelijk as wel).

[i agree]

i'd like to be part of *te teuchi tician* (??) it's a joke

was obsessed with zombi apocalopis
end of eletricity, end of civilication, breakdown, return to a more
primal, direct, primitive sort of lifestyle.

under no circumstanced want to be caught in zombie apocalypse
no guys, but in USA surrounded by all the wrong ppl

no sure where this leads to

filosophically it speaks about a certain uneasy feeling about this
complex we build called civilization

unsustainable, famous groups about population growth, energy
consumption, etc, non of it is sustainable

not a pessimist, but i think it is certainly gone. dont think it cannot
return, would require so much global collective effort that i dont see
anywere. element of greed, capitalism, etc. etc

in my lifetime, since i can remember, when i talk to my grandmother 1906

- no electricty
- no phone
- no cars

told me what a big thing it was when first car came

my mother told me the story on first home radio, powered by batteries,
had to walk to hydro power plant for recharge. just one channel

in my lifetime, first time few in '86

for me it's about acceleration, for lack of better word, humongous
desire to get ..

white city, chicago 1893 worlds fair: columbian exposition

first model of this explosive construction machine driven boon of
building big things. famous landscape designer came in.
famous architect, solivan.
this was the first electrified citied.
had to build it so quickly that it was crap neo... architecture
only color they had was white, and had to paint quickly, so they
invented spraypaint.
westinghouse, tesla introduced AC to the public for the first time
whole thing was like a meta-artwork in modern terms
when they first turned it on, there was this enormous flood of light,
everyone was gasping.
110yrs ago.. not so long

my work was inspired by...

teacher came into class 'did anyone see tron'
first home computers didnt touch me, but then came amiga 500 and it hit
me

what you see here is a piece called noisegate from time of
granular=synthesis `1992>2003`

large scale performance that wanted to create a kind fo second,
artificial nature, simulated physical spaces.

this was very intresting, the picture is from a never used subway
station in hannover.

we were looking for an interesting space, they thought they wuold build
a subway but they never did.

the now lies this unaccesible space that must have cost a fortune.
we build a lot of things that we don't need, consumerism
we are also bored to death, anyway it's a long discussion...

we talked a lot about cyborgs, machine people

*shows sweetheart 1997 film*

so.. very nineties, second parts it actually more interesting.. anyway

karma/cell 2006

started working with realtime 3d system based on game engine technology

wanted to have something that was more intuitive to work with
of course it turned out that it was way harder.

karma/cave 2004

it was a piece for a CAVE installation, such an abohorrent space, until
you put on the goggles and tech it becomes alive.

while we are building more simulation and virtual imemrsive space
as a side effect the actual planet and realitie goes away in terms
of present and health and togetherness

this is also part of civilization, from the unshielded exposed outside
to the evermore shielded, constructed

the book on no.. leas ... using old engish, old german text to show how
the way we live together and our needs as individuals change from the
middle ages.

surprise how we grow in population, now we need even more space. in the
middleages everyone would sleep in the same bed animals would be around
for reasons as warmth.

in NY they had floorplans, for the richer people, it showed sort of mini
apartments together in a sort of meta appartment.
like a unique, discrete kind of unit.
weird kind of logic there,

2008-2011 ZEE
2005-2007 FEED

wanted to create this immersive space with strobes etc
in essence you are in innerspace, you don't see your hand in front of
you.

you are really quite isolated. in particular the stroboscopes create
some sort of 2d/3d space, that seems to come from inside you.

`video ZEE shown`

- it was the most insane thing ive ever
- at first it was extremely anxeety
- once you open the door, boom
- you don't even know where you are
- i didn't know it was 20 minuttes, felt like 2m
- maybe this is what it's like being dead
- fractals appearing
- colours patterns appearing, things flying in the ear
- electric crackling, lighting on a tiny scale
- no idea of depth
- oh i'm on another planet
- wasn't sure if it's inside my head or..
- cannot really rationalise it
- kidn of loss of consciouness

"want to do it again"

grew up half way in the country side, linz, half way in the city.
that is an important factor, antropocene, the majority of people already
lives in city. in future 75% ppl will live in the city.
so pretty much in 100yrs most people living in landscapy area's to most
living in cityscape.
grown up and born in the city.

my wife has never slep in the outdoors, the idea of sleeping without a
shelther is absolutely abhorrent

things going away that you don't even know about, have been emotionally
involved with

you can see it on tv channels, we have these very talented, extremele
well outfitten documentary teams for discovery channel. they record like
the wonders of the world, like the best of.
uninterrupted landscaped,etc. all of this will go away in short time.

anyway, i got this urge, 5 years ago to visit open landscape, leave
airport etc.

kind of prototypical, i defined it as a work and a meditation on nature.

this is about constructed reality, editing animation, layering,
transforming, and certainly selecting, it's a selected form of ...

`measure 2013-4`

it's a series of tablaux

17 minutes
my attention deficit disorder piece, never really going anywhere

all about the construction, and manurism

i remembered manurism, wikipedia has three points to it

- distinct behavioural trait to itself
- .. style in art
- .. distortion of elements

ORT 2016

working on a project, similar to the drone piece the lukas showed

i've had the priveledge to be in the emeriates
explosively growing area's, china

epithamise for me the scale, proportion, potency of what is possible, by
means of contemporary tehcnology.
reshaping landscapes

*showing pictures of dubay*

it's like vegas on steroids

nothing is older than, 15-20 years old. like a lab city. building is the
wrong world, it's being painted...
hubris, buildin a place where you have no reason to really be, there is
no water.. so all the water comes from desalination plants. the most
energy intesive way to get sweet water.
you would think there would be solar panels... but no
58% guest laborers, otherwise no entitlements
if you have never left for more than 2days in 20 years you might apply
for citizenship

city is very starwars, why no solar panels.
when they build it, they had to have it now, when times cmomes they
would rebuild it, didn't have solar tech then.

but it doesn't even have the freaking right sand for concrete.
the sand there is incompentent.
beaching in south easy asia are being stripped from china into dubay.

really striking.

when you drive through the desert it's like open public space, but in
dubay there is no public space, it's all private 

salt lake city, either military or industry (very toxic, incineration
without filters).

biggest copper mind sit right next to salt lake city.

could be called sublime landscapes. even if it's a park, it's completely
defined...

ORT will be round 360 projection, maelstrom of "natural images" but all
3d.

have you seen Ed Atkins show, 3d feels like a natural expression

immersion comes from the outside, once we leave the inside and go to the
outside and see the sky. it's all about scale.

q. bit more of measure. human measure of all things
almost post-antopocentric. humans are not the scale of all things

a. humans are indirectly in there, the way it's formulated, sort of
media mind. eye candy. always the element of intriguing pictures.
there is always this romantiscism, painters, i enjoyed it a lot.
the sublime in painting at least, bigger than live, risky business

it's all about being in a safe comfortable distance to the elements of
nature. and marvelling at it.
