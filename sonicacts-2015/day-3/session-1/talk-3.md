*starts with film*


the aesthetics of disappearance: a land without people

aftermath of the 2003 gulf ware

2004, the margateh cox; south of irak
the butterfly hunter

1991 mass graves hid the victims of kosovo war

blue butterflies come to the flowers that grow on the nutrients released
by the bodies

however efficient the disposal is, there is always a sign in the
landscape

---

also talk about the virtual disapperance

cox working south of irak 2003, after the work

resonances and similarities to 1991 gulf war

in the new way conflict is represented

amost exclusivly from the air and the technologies adapter in the work

not the first time aereal warfare, but new level of sophistication

reminiscent of early games

(note: WHat is the name of that netart game)

---

inspired by ...'s essay: "esthentics of disappearance"

recals mellies, french film pioneer; trickery, etc.

one time camera stops and film jams.
when he looks at the footage later he sees that he is able to create a
magic trick (horse + cart turned into man)

examining Cox process'
=> like archeology when you start digging you have to be very careful

nr of archives; foto of asian collection, smithsonian collection
german archeologist, ernst herzfelt
fotograph the sites he was excavating

retouched the foto where he removes his shadow from the image

also took fotos from such a distance that it was hard to see what the
site was

very contemporary, like mars photos

---

second set of images that i looked at, while developing the work.
first time photograph was used directly in a war situation

images in the archives of the earospace museum
area surveilance, by specialist unit

small planes with large camera, dark room on the ground

picture of trench systems

1918, landscape very destructed, completely stransfomed

like surface of the moon

pock-marks of bombs

---

processing of three images, identification of target, then bombing.

in the end still a trace mark left

image of a trench on the ground, see skulls

so, taking image from the air to erase evidence of it

bit like a fantasy land, anything can be projected

e.g. landscape of a desert with no clear side/people/owner, so it's
seems it can be occupied

eg. zionist call to build isreal state,

air pictures lebanon syria, rich of roman sites

image reminiscent of hiroshima, point source and then destruction around
it

---

book by kitty houser, shadow sites

developemnt of aereal archeology

how english archeologist were also inthe british airforce and flying
over europe

they were often discovering new archeological sites

when you have a verical position above the ground and the sun is very
low you can see the site shortly because of the shadows

---

filming in middle east in 2003-2004 in the ground eastern desert in
jordan

notices structure build out of volcanic rock

medieval structures

also more pics of iraqi trench systems

trench system at border of german by ottoman troups, still very visible
from 1st world war

picture of bronze age coppermine

---

second film , explicitly made from photographs

shadowsites

prehistory all the way up to modern agriculture.

shown so that there is no border or frame, competely contained withing
the space (just take one wall of room and replace it with the film)
