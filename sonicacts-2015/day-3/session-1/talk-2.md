what is prosthetic littoral

the interafce between land and water

sediment and water

as it is constructed by an array as 

- sand bag
- erosion stop fence
- ..
- dredge containment facility

hard: concrete tetrapods

soft: geogrid, softer

wetbag: geotube

constructing dams, geo textiles

there is something very strange and beautiful about these landscapes

one of the few people that has been paying proper attention to this

toshio shibata

this also happened to harted things

US army corps of engineers mat sinking unit (giant 3d printer?)

st. francisville casting fields, banks of missisipy river.

---

there are many, but the most intense to me is dredging

suck, scape sediment

then dispose it at another place

when you put them together you get the "dredge cucle"

- gravity fed (accelerated erosion)
- forced uplift (recovery -> refinement -> ..)

---

talk about the scale, but i'll abbreviate it a bit as micheal has done
such a nice job.

in the US natural erosion about 30%

accelerated/human use about 70%

they are not abberations, but the norm, standard condition of sed
movement.

1 feedback, jamaica bay

NY harbour

to understand we need to start quite far south of it, in panama

oct 2006 doubling the size of the panama canal

- widening and deepening of entrance channels
- raising water level of gatun lake

huge amount of earth moved

route shifts to the US intermodal system and Suez, erosion of
competitive advantage

---

caused by a change in specification of large ships

panamax ships passed exactly through the canal, 1m on each side.

now, pospanamax ships, wouldn't pass through the cana, those ships are
more efficient; cheaper

so now we need a bigger new panama canal

---

there is a "engineering shockwave" emanating from this, almost all of
the mayor ports are engaged in a process of expansion themselves.

positing the surplus of sediment to build new silands, etc.

building new cranes

increasing capacity of taking stuff of ships

---

hit NY hardware

over a decade now they are dealing with this
raising bridge, to accomodate airdrift of larger ships

more dredging, with unintentional ..

---

map of maintenace dreding

sudden sedimentary surplus, much beyond what is ordinary found in the NY
harbour area

---

maintenance drediging :highly contaminated

mud dump site, under sea

sand from expansion dredging is typically much cleaner

suitable for beach restauration, ..

back to jamaica bay

---

characterized by marsh islands

lost about half of their landmass 20th centure

predicted to loose the rest in 21th century

program of marsh island retauration

somewhat strange restoration

US army corp, only within the classic boundaries

who would have guessed that the expansion of the panama canal would lead
to restoration

---

craney island in the estuary of the james river, hampton roads

about 7 different port cities, port of virginia

here majority of dredge is placed here in the containment facility

very large, almost entirely featureless, each cell size of NY central park

---

if craney island is a machine, what is it a machine for and how does it
	work

comes out of pipe and places in one corner

gentle slop over the island

then by gravity sorted by particle size

weirs can be raised (or lowered) but typically raised

island is self constructing, coarse deposits mined

---

rotation cucles of activity and inactivity

each of the three cells goes through a cycle of ^

opportunistic ecologies, novel assemblages of plants and animals

in response to industrial sorting of soil and industrial rhythm

---

important part of the easter flighway, many birds come to depend on it.

unintended consequence of a series of earth moving practices

---

harold fisk, meanders and oxbows

deposition on it's innner banks, erosions on it's other banks

therefor always moveing

every thousand years or so the river changes where its delta goes

delta lobes and avulsions

---

specific mechanism by which this does is flooding

natural and 

as european and .. settlers arrived they realized missisipy river is a
good place to live.

also had to deal with the flooding

began building earthen levees to protect from the flood

---

1928 levees unable to hold back the flood, biggest flood in history

US army corp of engineers (again) was tasked with the reconstruction of
the river to make sure this never happens again

had to recontruct levees, etc

also realized it had to allow the river to leave it's current path in a
controlled manner

called flood ways

---

controlled with spillways (morganza spillway 2014)

old river control valve.

controls the river and holds it into its old position

prevent the river from switching to the .. pay

---

at this point even if all of the constraits would be removed its quite
likely that there is not enough to halt the process of landloss in the
delta / resptore.

the response: Louisiana coastal master plan

throw everything at the delta, every possible means of restoration

including many untested things

also dealing with deepwater horizon damages

all the damages money cannot be spend in any other way than restore this
delta

---

this is the beginning of my projec to see how we can build alternative
valves etc
