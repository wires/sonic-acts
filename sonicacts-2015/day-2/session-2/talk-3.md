# installation

after reading earth sounds, earth signal
astounishing it wasn't writting 20yrs earlier

outlines artworks, experimental music, etc responding to earth energy,
electromagnet spectrum

empty set

exploring sound waves and noise in analog hardware, etc

after this, first non studio project, called "medium"

taking studio based hardware based project and moving it to a
architectural context

performance in response to the architecture, abandoned ... in ...
england

the house imprinted it's own signature onto these very elemental
signals.

*signal* was the logical step, .. now working with the ionosphere

with that movement we tried testing it ourself, working with amateur
radio technology. 

turned out to be hard., approach with transmediale ..
got access to better equipment, made project materialize

other speaker

*playing audio clip*

worked on HF radio band, 40m

...

initiall started to implement the project with amateur radio
100W transmitters, 3 meters tall
black box is a resonator, just coils tuned to the particular freq we are
working

antenna in berlin, another in bristol

for propagations to happen and bounce of athmosphere, depends on stuff

they were about to put the project on the shelf, because they didn't
manage to get good enough propagation

shows propagation projection charts

using old radio station that communicates with battleships

issoudun station, NAU on the 60m band, not a amateur band, no
restrictions; 100.000W station (damn!)

only potentially one hour where you would get propagation where they
could work.

started doing the tests, because 100kW RF is put out, it is very hard to
do another transmission with nearby frequency because of interference

the solution that was agreed on,
in south of france they were going to pass the signal on a nearby
station

from berlin with ISDN -> nau, then back via the two stations

only managed to get 30 minutes of propagation, during the performance

kind of forgot that it was a music project and needed a phase of
composition. withing previous project they were able to work in there
process, but in this project they had a more incremental/iterative workflow.

trade material, test it, etc

showed radio spectrum during the performance, showing SDR spectrums

on left original sound, right the imprinted sounds

# QA session

Q (audience). about carrier, am etc

A. the original signals were just sines, etc. the imprint from the
athmosphere/ionosphere.

because its' 60-100km barrier, which is constantly change, the signal
constantly get imprinted different

also lots of EM radiation, for instance fluorescent lights produce a lot
of interference

Q. regarding your inspiration Kahns work, seems you are more into tuning
in

A. yeah, so it's not like point a microphone at the sky or something,

mentions environmental sounds

more interested in the process vs field record the universe

A. lots of these projects are about materializing this EM radio
something that is carring information that is then stripped away,
physically .. by the athmosphere

A (emptyset). in the film, i definitely felt we were part of the problem
*laughs*

---

Q. remark about a antenna array in alaska, extreme low frequency

A. mentions antenna array in troms√∏

we are more interested in the peotic essence of these projects than all
the technical possibilities.

the project got more and more complicated and we definately got to a
limit of how big we could make the project.

if you have a lot of money you ould set up a studio in one of these
transmission stations. instead of making a pretty good album you could
make a very good album.
don't think it does more for the peotry of the thing, becomes a bit like
stamp collecting

---

Q. about radio amateurs

A. emphasis about the intuitive sense of how this goes into space,
borderline cult thing around EM transmission. 19th century, william
crooks, ectoplasmic fotography, visiting mediums

it became separated. this question of materiality, various entities,
ether. it went more to instrumentality,what these waves can do to us.

regarding the mathematical understanding that there is no materialism to
it. it also related to the EM sickness, in that it doesn't have a
material existence

---

Q. .. about the sound for th time

A. interesting for my collegue david, he's into shortwave radio, knows
more about spectrum, etc. even for his music, composing with stuff that
he captures. he understands being a soudn engineer what it implies
technically. 

A (emptyse) watching your film it was a good metafour for how it's
unavoidable

maybe they are less bothered at night?

A. one more comfortable at night, radiation of sun bothered in the
daytime. probably more wave during the daytime, than nighttime.

A (es). yeah the sun produces probably more radiation that anything on
earth. 

---

Q (arie). a lot of the stuff about technological problem of
transmission, where your work deals more with the .. of radio that seems
to me like a important point in time ...  we have never looked at
getting sick from EM radiation before.  not sure if this is a question,
or someone wants to remark on this

regarding Q about sun. it's important to look at different character of
EM, natural looks very different from artificial radiation.

A. as far as I understand it, in particular on cell phone radiation
there is not restriction to how strong it can be. there is really no

remark between ionizing and nonionizing radiation

- EM associated with mobile phones non ionizing
- sun is ionizing

uranium is natural.

if you are sick you are sick, right?

---

Q. could you remark a bit about analog/digital

A. thomaswatson, graham bells assistant was the first to listen to
natural radio. everything we do is somehow linked back to this event.
the first man to listen to natural radio.

but then pushing it further, like creating the 2000KM cirquit, making it
realtime etc. 

A. instead of working with SDR whcih seems like a blackbox, it prefer ..
maybe it's some sort of nostalgia.

regarding to the comment on the balcony, interested to have the
discussion further. stuff i dont understand and don't want to say things
that would mislead ppl.

Q. some corrections and additions

- wasn't thomas edison, but .. mhland lewis was a dentist. from the
  early 20th century on, there was a confusion about natural/non natural
  ~ ionizing/nonioning radiation.

- people would end up in asylum because they thought their fillings
  would pick up demonic/non demonic radation


about the sun, ionizing/non ionizing

as far as I know, our athmosphere and ionosphere block most of the
radiation.

visible spectrum, and UV, which is harmful, remains..
