- been at the site for a week, getting everything working
- due to the late, location change
- been pretty stressful for him and the team

thanks for coming

i will try to becoheren, if i get incoheren arie will ask me a question

have a moment of clarity, want to exploit it

it has been 7mnth of work, wasn't intentded

was a small project part of the dark ecology project

geologic imagination book contains a talk with mode details

works liket his cannot be realized without a collaboration
not just commision and fundion body

it's a huge logistical problem

all the rumours you heard a probably true

stupid regulations in NL, it wasn't a problem in norway

we can hear from 1.5cm til 7m (? 20hz) wavelength, but it goes much lower

below that it becomes like a touch, beating

we occupy a very silent range of the spectrum, 

the further down you go, there comes a roars

what kind of sounds are being payed attention to

subjective consioucness transformations

hearing is a sight, not a condition

..

what causes these ultrasounds

eg a meteor, going "underwater" (air is like water)

pressure wave. usually a N-shaped wave

few seconds later you get a U-shaped wave, reflection from the 

global warming, 

huge surface of material falls into water

avelanges

volcanos 1-3 hz (rather high for infrasound)

nothernlights, disputed how they are being produced

"the voice of the see"

some bit of spectrum was saturated

microbaromes

you can be in the middle of the desert and hear the sounds of the sea

inverse square low

below 15hz soundwaves just continue to travel
immense amounds of force involved, 1000km's they travel

temperature inversion in our athmosphere
if you go up, temp. suddenly changes

eventuall bends the waves back down

animal kingdom intuitively knows this

wolfcalls elephant sounds
they do it after dark

during the day its solid noise, grows at night, goes back down again in the morning

acoustic waves, not EM

imagine a soundwave that is so long that it takes 8 minutes to complete
one cycle

what is the difference between weather and infrasound

KNMI, arbitrary boundary


---

historically, the contexts that feed into infrasound are incredibly
rich

this is an image from the very first time scientist realized that
infrasound travels so far

barometer baro-graph, suddenly measured a blip

explosion of .. volcano continued to travel the global for a few days

- mine explosions
- aircraft sonic booms
- oil refinery gas flares
- space debris re-entry
- wind turbines
- nuclear testing

the spike in which we contrinue the most in this bandwidth

there are at the moment 50 infrasound monitoring stations that are
picking up sounds and cross referencing the locations to find
nuclear tests

but also generating data that helps us understanding

CT-BT network

global array systems, gun sound sensing in WWI

important contextual

1986 accoustic holography for sound control

wave field synthesis

reverse process of phased array

came from knowledge of seismic arrays

christiaan hugyens

microphones for infrasound

contextual explosion

at a certain moment everything becomes part of it.

no longer a technical detail, but need to know how metal blade slides in
the sound.

last comment,

instead of coming out with a certain expectation to the site

site of discharge, kind of a spark

between the people that are perceiving,
the surrounding
the event itself

not so much about the object and the sounds you are hearing,

but the resonant projection that go both ways
