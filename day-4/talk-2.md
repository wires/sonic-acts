bar-tailed godwit, superstar of the ..

starts in alaska, yellow see, back to alaska

was unknown until recent years

goes 5-days non-stop from alaska to newsealand

doesn't leave alaska until weather conditions around entire path are
okay

sitting in alaska it knows the weather conditions for 5 days, truely
amazing


pidgin, post duif

- can detect intensity and direction of magnetic field

- polarized, ultraviolet light

- less 1/1000 th athomospheric pressure

- 0.05 Hz infrasound

compasses

- sun azimuth (time compensated by a biological clock)
- geomagnetic field
- rotation of the stars

so those are the compasses, but what is the map

suggested:

- gradients of geomagnetic field ? only N-S, no EW gradient
- ofactory cues (i just don't think this works, unstable atmosphere)
- sight/landmarks? with frosted lenzes it can get back to loft about 1km
  without seeing it
- infrasound?

infrasounds

absorption increases as frequency

sea level:

- 90% of 1000 hz tone by 7km
- 90% of 1 hz 3000km
- 90% of 0.01 Hz tone by > 40.000 km

wavelength longer at lower frequencies

- 340m at 1hz
- .2 hz 1.7km peak mircroseis frequency
- .1hz .1 hz

wait a minute.. with binaural 2cm seperation how can you localize it

move around, make circles and use doppler shift

have to keep velocity constant, or need to know speeding up/down

straopheric shearing 

silent zone, where there is no refraction (it's not reflection)

- temperature inversion or windshear

where sound comes from?
earth

if you are shaking the ground, the steep sides of the mountains will
radiate the sound.

birds only navigating when there are earthquares? no
where does the sound come from?
microbaromes

[kedar webb, 2005]

microseisms, when waves hit the ocean bottom

between 0-4 micron displacements at 1(/6th) second

1km^2 going up and down this much will create, 125dB

pidgeon has to learn what it's loft "sounds" like

birds and infrasound travel foor 100s of km in the atmosphere

do worse in the winter, when the athmosphere is much noisier.

pidgeons avoid lakes, why? lake surface is creating microbaromes
