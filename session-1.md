# the human impact from a geological 'anthropocene' perspective

Mark Williams

- geologists use present earth processes to interpret the past
- past also teaches us about the present

q: is the human impact as fundamental as the great changes in the past

- enormity of geological time
- 150 yrs/minute in 30 minute talk :-)
- life started: 3800 milj years back

- fundamentally change: hydrosphere, atmostphere, water
- tim lenton et all, 2008, tipping points in the climate system

- paul kripson, dutch scientist, repopularized term anthropocene

### fossil signals

- at least 2.5 milj. years back rocks by early humans/monkeys
- cattle, development of settlements
- industrial impact

- 1945: 60m bridge
- 2000+: 4000m bridge
- exponential growth (nr. of vehicles)

- radiogenic signal by atoms bombs, baseband for anthropocene epoch

### biosphere

- biosphere on earth, as far as we know, unique
- ancient, recilient
- 2500m yrs ago, bacterial
- 650m yrs ago, beginner of animals, sponges
- 550m yrs, first animals
- 540m yrs, animals with a tail and head, make the first burrows
- 530-520m yrs, first skeletons, probably related to hunting caused by
  directionality

summaru: for 540m years we had complex live

- 2m years ago, evolution of sentience

q: what is unique about the anthopocene biosphere?
q: what have humans done

- definately caused extinctions
  - megafauna
  - pimm et all, 2014: current extinction rate > 1000x background rate
    - species with very small ranges are increased quickly
- happened before, 6 extinctions; significant, but not unique

Where in the food chain

- not on the top, but in the middle (eat a lot fo stuff)
  - bonhommeay et all 2013

- misses the point: 25-40% net primary production
97% of biomass is what we did

- fishing down food web, pauly et all 1998, 2002
changed dynamics of the ocean

- transported organisms all over the planet (rabbits, humans)
  a global signal of neobiota

- the great american interchange (armadillos went from south-north)
  clear fossil record

### what humans have done is fundamentally different

- regions that could not possible have neobiotic species
- equally nr of invasive species (McNeely 2001)

- fundamentally changed the landscape (cannot find in europe untouched
  region)

- ellis et all, 2010. anthromes 2
- 75% of ice free landscape is dominated by humans
  again, fundamentally different from anything that has happened before

- earth is no longer dominated by 'natural' ecosystem with humans
  distorbing them, but ...

- tehnological interaction with the biosphere

- eg. photosynthetic paths ~> transplant into higher species (super
  plants)

- planet of the chickens, other bones, anatomically different
  (rapid structural change)

humans fundamentally changes the biosphere

### hydrosphere

- oceans cover 2/3 of the surface of the planet
- however, lets focus on river systems

q: what have humans done to river systems?

- rivers in a world without trees and plants (500m yrs ago)
  no trees, shrubs, grass, no complex biosphere (mayb algea, bacterial)

- then rivers rampage, run amoc. nothing to stop them. braided rivers
  accros the planet

- 460m yrs ago, forrest, plants started to develop.

- rivers are tamed, morphology of rives is changed

- banks of rivers contrained by roots fo plants, trees

- ancient burrows in 400m yrs old fossil rives, lungfish that lived on
  the land

q: why is this relevant

humans are reverse engineering the river system

altered the flux of sediments in rivers

- deforested
- agriculture
- mining
- transportation

200 km^3 sediment by humans

- new styles of rivers
- humans global agents of river change

- citarum river, west java
  distict geological signal in the river

- nile river, what have humans done

fundamentally altered

- NL, use water to deal with waste
- large structures below ground

all potentially fossilizable

- london, worlds first megacity, transport collapsing
- what do they do to deal with it
- starts to form new kind of burrow
- 1861 worlds first metro system
- 1907 giantic trace fossil below the ground, then spreads around the
  world

symbol of where we are now at:

- global interconnectedness
- move more sediment then all the rivers together
- our capacity to build huge underground structures

we could argue that these changes are transient

- biosphere could recover to some stable state (when humans disappear)
- however, structures are so significat that we left a signal that will
  remain very far into the future

doesnt seem to slow down, but accelerate.

if the change accelerates, perhaps something more fundamental is beginning

Q: lukas, "wonderful" ?

A: dont want kids to live in a world with elephan sculptures
