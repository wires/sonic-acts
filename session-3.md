## Subscendence

hello nice humans, or "horrifying agents of catostrophic change" (or
something he said)

- the whole is greater than the sum of its parts
- say the whole is the biosphere
- screw the polar bears, someone else will take their place

we might want to change around whole > sum parts

fan of OOO, object oriented ontology

- entity contains a more parts than it's whole
- like dr. who tardis

whole smaller than all of its part

megacities,like houston

hard to find if you look for a whole > sum parts

parts of houston bigger (ontologicall) than its whole

called this phenomenon: subscencedence

used in christian theology, precisely in the way that he needs

jezus declared that he became very small to safe us

see touch weather, cannot see touch climate

hyperobject transcend their parts, that's why you cannot find them

even black holes evaporate, can only be destroyed by itself

- married couple smaller than two unmarried people
- married couple fragile

- black hole, appearance subscense it essence

isn't death like that?

hyperobject disappear downwards into something more physical

hyperobj viscosity, stick to you whereever you are

dont transcend you, subscend you

agriculure has certain logistics attached to it, that caused
industrialization and hence global warming

there is hope

in terms of energy the problem is simple, turn of the tap
and become a little german town that provides it's own energy

the world without us
anthropocenic outlook, 
but it's already here (the world without us)

things withdraw (as OOO likes to say)

implosive holism, hyperobject less than the sum of its parts

subscendence is why you need a passport
- not to the guarantee your nationality
- to guarantee the existance of the state

speaks about terrorism/religion

lone wolfs,
- watch: terror from within, timothy mcfade...

looking for whole to be huge and overarching
cannot find this, so assume they are lone wolfs

adding an ecological context to intrepretation

you cannot really draw a line around this in advance

no way to ascertain whether the pleroma of beings has a range

infrasound, long wave synthesis

very large entities (such as mountains) sometimes move in such a way to create sound

such large wavelength, he compares it to a hologram

infrasonic wavefront picks up everything it passes (shape of mountains
etc)

never hear the wind as such, only hear it in the doorways, trees leafs

only hear translation of this

long wave synthesis for pneumatic compress
pneumatic hose
barometric pressure
realitve humidity
wind shear
skin pressure
ear canal depth
frost
fungus
mobile listeners
assorted gravel
distance between air molecules
moss
earth circumference
stratosphere
or rotation
soil conduction
shock wave reverberation
oil mining
chemical explosions
long range communcation
power cables
power supply
thunder
supersonic flight
impeller accoustics
2.4 ghz laptop computer
400s waveforms

age of assymetry

so much more scientific data
makes things more mysterious

cold war like explosition of knowledge

unlike hegel, art history

in retrospect just a .. marks the beginning of the antrophocene

global warming lasts for 100.000 years

humans full of inner space

thinking or feeling subscendence, it is suseptability, we can be touched

subscendence means what we humans are chameleon like entities
susseptible to ...

any visual artist knows that

- seeing <-> knowing, too easy linkage
- seeing subscendent by touching

seeing, like hearing, is a part of touching

touch is lonely .. humble
nearer, more intimate

subscendence close causing of transcend

polar bair appearance <-> polar bear

no longer a problem with this if the bear goes extinct

subscendend by it's appearence

symbiotic colonies
humans with prothesis like cattle, fossile fuel

when billions of ppl start their cars
gap between me and the species i'm part of
cannot point to it

does one thing really well, destroy earth

right now we are fingernails of a zomby

what is destroying the human .. is the human

brittle, inconsistent
