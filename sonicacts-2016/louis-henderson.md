### Louis Henderson — Animism is the only sensible version of materialism

- animist thought,

- activation of different modes of being

- macroeconomic oppression and censorship of these cultures

> "self actualization"

remains under colonial repression

- act of perceiving the gods
- contagious processes of a collective assembly of renunciation.

- body under going the trance
- gods mounting the body


animist rituals always a collective experience

=> drums, alcohol, animals, film maker, ...

subjectivity as a ... and collective thing

#### Ethnographic cyberspace travelers

gene barrow, into the internet, ghana

le LOLz ~ sakawa(?) boys

"steal back some of the riches stolen from us"

- make gold form the internet

sakawa boys ; old hard drives to find photographs, passwords, bank details, etc

-> scammers

#### gilles deleuze

- Rouge ~ film maker

- cinetrance
- ethnographic cinema in the first person

- camera being used as a lens to *see* other things

- "mechanical eye, electronic ear" - no longer his self

=> "cinetrans"

- rimbaud "Eye am an Another"

- ethnographic film, no effect until camera-eye-man-lans walks into the group , getting the spirits to manifest in the body

rimbaud ~> wants to be come a voyant/seeer ~> poët

### code as a fetishistic form

- macbook alive with it's gold and copper, etc

# Suggestion about reclaiming animism

> reclaing animism does not mean than that we have even been an animist
> because one is never an animist in general
> only in terms of assemblages that generate methamtic
> animism may however be a name to recalimg these assemblages
> in order not to enslave us


#### The Eyes of a Fly

- fpga/cams' ~ old idea


### Amazon Indians


what people have in common with animals: body

- every living being once was a human
- beings left humanity to become animals

- west: animals pure material

"animus"

- what makes us human is our body
- our soul is the most common thing in the world
- everything is animated

what is sensible, what is materiality

sensible, perceived through the senses

what is empirically understood
